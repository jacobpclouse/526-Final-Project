# 526-Final-Project
ICSI Final Project for Dolunay (Luna) Dagci and Jacob Clouse - Spring 2023

## Paper: Alternative N-bit Key Data Encryption for Block Ciphers

## Goals:
1) Figure out hashing, figure out XOR / bitwise (encrypt & decrypt)
2) Combine the two above, figure out how to encrypt a single block with both
3) Figure out how to reverse and decrypt that block
4) Figure out how to chain blocks n number of times (based on user input) - encryption then decryption
5) Figure out how to add the obfuscation with Alt n bits
6) Cleanup code, add additional funtionality and potentially GUI

## Issues:
- [ ] How do we retrieve a public key and multiply it with our own private key?
- [ ] How do we determine the block size of our encryption?
