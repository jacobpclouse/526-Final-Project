kk write a program that takes the current input plus the block size we are aiming for

if the input length is less than the block size, then we divide the block size by the length of the input, store in variable called numOfReps

we incriment numOfReps by one, then we concatonate the string

kk write a program that takes the current input plus the block size we are aiming for
if the input length is less than the block size, then we subtract length of input from the block size , store in variable called numberOfCharsLeft and incriment it by 1
we then can generate a random string of text that is exactly the same length of numberOfCharsLeft
we take that string and concatonate it to the existing text and update the existing variable 
it should now be long enough to hit the size constriaints
